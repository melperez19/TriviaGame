# Walt Disney Themed TriviaGame

[Click here to demo this application!](https://melperez19.github.io/TriviaGame/)

* I created a trivia game that shows only one question at a time until the player answers it or their time runs out.

* If the player selects the correct answer, a screen congratulating them for choosing the right option will appear. After a few seconds, the next question will be displayed without user input.

* The scenario is similar for wrong answers and time-outs.

  * If the player runs out of time, the player will be advised that their time's up and display the correct answer. After a few seconds, the next question will populate.
  * If the player chooses the wrong answer, the player will be told that they selected the wrong option and then display the correct answer. After a few seconds, the next question will populate.

* On the final screen, the number of correct answers, incorrect answers, and an option to restart the game (without reloading the page) will be displayed.

-This game involves the use of HTML, CSS, Javascript and jQuery.
